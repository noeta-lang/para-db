//! `para.db` — the database layer's **native driver** (aether DB0), the only native piece of the
//! DB stack (the query builder, repository/unit-of-work, and `@sql` tier above it are pure Noeta).
//!
//! One module and one extern type, rooted at `para`:
//!   * `db`         — `db.connect(dsn) -> Connection`; the dsn scheme selects the driver.
//!   * `Connection` — `execute(sql, params) -> int`, `query(sql, params) -> List<Map<string, dyn>>`,
//!     `migrate(dir) -> int`, `seed(dir) -> int`, `close()`; a shared handle over a boxed
//!     [`driver::SqlDriver`].
//!
//! The **swappable-driver seam** is [`driver::SqlDriver`]: SQLite ([`sqlite::SqliteDriver`], behind
//! `ring-sqlite`) and PostgreSQL ([`pg::PostgresDriver`], behind `ring-postgres`) are the two impls;
//! the dsn scheme selects between them and further backends arrive the same way — no change to the
//! Noeta surface, the query builder, the repository, or the `@sql` tier. Like `para-p2p`, this crate
//! is compiled and linked only when a
//! program depends on the `para/db` package, and registered through the fixed native-extension
//! convention ([`NOETA_EXTENSIONS`], re-exported by the package's `native` entry crate).

/// public;`). Under cargo's default thread-per-test that is a data race on a shared resource: one
/// test drops the schema out from under another's `CREATE TABLE`, and Postgres reports the collision
/// from its system catalog — `duplicate key value violates unique constraint

///
/// The tests share a database *by design* (one DSN, no per-test database to create), so the fix is to
